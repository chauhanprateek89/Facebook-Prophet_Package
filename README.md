# Forecasting using Prophet Package

Using Facebook's forecasting package, Prophet, prediction was done to determine the number of web hits an article is going to receive on Wikipedia.  
Data was scraped from Wikipedia for this project and forecasting was then applied to make the prediction.  
This project helped to build an understanding for time series forecasting and how the Prophet package works, which is an implementation of Markovian Chain Monte Carlo model.  
The report and explaianation of code can be found in the pdf file.
